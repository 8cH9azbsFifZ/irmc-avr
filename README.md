irmc-avr
========
IRMC stands for Internet Relay Morse Code. 
This is an implementation of a [MOIP](https://github.com/8cH9azbsFifZ/moip) client.

Build the firmware under OSX:
port install avr-binutils avr-libc avr-gcc avrdude
make burn

#Testing
Observe the "DG6FL/AVR" on http://mtc-kob.dyndns.org on channel 33.

## Testing with MorseKOB 3.0 (Java)
This [software](http://kob.sdf.org/morsekob/morsekob30/MorseKOB.jar) will run on
Linux, Windows and OSX. With the [RXTX software](http://morsekob.org/morsekob30/help.htm)
for Java (i.e. [librxtxSerial.jnilib](http://blog.brianhemeryck.me/installing-rxtx-on-mac-os-mountain-lion/) on OSX) it is even possible to connect to external hardware. 
NB: before you transmit make sure you uncheck the "circuit closer".

# Hardware
I use an [duemilanove](http://arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/arduinoBoardDuemilanove) with a 
[W5100 Ethernet Shield](http://arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/ArduinoEthernetShield)

The wiring is as follows: (see [pin mapping](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMapping168))

| Pin	| Arduino Name 	| Function 	| 
| :---- | :-----------	| :-------	|
| PD6 	|               | Speaker |
| PC5 	| analog Input 5| Key (5V!) |
| PD7 	|               | Connect LED |
| PD4   |               | Data LED |
| PC1 	| analog Input 1| Disconnect Switch |

> 1. Only 12 presets are programmed, instead being able to connect to an arbitrary frequency/wire.
> 2. PD6 is a GPIO that generates a ~650Hz square wave tone.
> 3. Some clock jitter results in 4ms variation in timming was observed.
> 4. I have it configured to interface to a separate sidetone generator for keying so the key input is expecting a 5V pulse.
> 5. I did not like the way I implemented the MorseKOB latch function in the original irmc, so I did not add that function into the avr version. (maybe someday)

Code Quality
============
This is experimental code.
